# Movie Website

A movie website application built with React, Vite, and Bootstrap. This project allows users to explore movies, add new ones, and view detailed information about each movie.

## Features
- **Home Page**: Displays a grid of popular movies fetched from The Movie Database (TMDb) API.
- **Add Movie**: Form to add new movies to the list, including title, overview, release date, and poster path.
- **Movie Details**: Shows detailed information about a specific movie, including poster, overview, release date, and more.
- **About**: Provides information about the website and its purpose.
- **Contact Us**: Contact information for user inquiries and support.

## Tech Stack
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Vite**: For fast development and build tooling.
- **Bootstrap**: For styling and responsive design.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the TMDb API.
- **React Router**: For navigating between pages.

### Vite Configuration
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:
- **@vitejs/plugin-react**: Uses Babel for Fast Refresh.
- **@vitejs/plugin-react-swc**: Uses SWC for Fast Refresh.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-website.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd movie-website
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash

    ```
4. Start the development server:
    ```bash

    ```

## Notes
- Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in `MovieProvider.js` with your actual TMDb API key.
- Ensure you have the necessary environment set up for running React applications.
